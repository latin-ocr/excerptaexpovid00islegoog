had done, had now become impossible. Political virtue consisted
in being content 10 occupy a subordinate position, and to carry
out 1110 will of the ruler. No wonder, therefore, that many
Romans abandoned the stage of public 1110, and found their
satisfactiou in the enjoyments which private independence offered.
Life in Rome was now 01110 01 pleasure and gaiety; exertion
101 the good of the state was at an end, and every one sought
his own private advantage. Under these influences Ovid grew
up. The calamitous times 01 1110 civil wars had already passed
by, and at Rome all was again tranquil, and moved on in settled
course. Only the wish 01 1110 father urged him forward in the
direction 01 publio 111ος and he had already in reality held
several offices-had been Triumvir Capitalis, Centumvir, and
Judex. Τ110 death 01 his brother, at the early age 01 twenty,
seems to have made' the father more 'indulgent to his younger
son, so that he was now enabled to surrender himself more fully
10 his natural and almost irresistible inclination for poetry. In
accordance with 1110 01101010 01 the day he undertoolr a journey to
Sicily, Graece, and Asia Minor, which occasioned his absence
110111 Romaim several years. He had already corne forward as
an author, and his poema had attracted attention, and introduced
him into the circle 01 the most distinguished poets then living, by
whom he was encouraged and excited to farther exertions.
Among these he mentions Aemilius Macer, Licinius Macer,
Ponticus, Bassus, Horace, Tibullus, end Propertius. Virgil 110
had only soen, but not enjoyed his friendship3 Tibullus also died
too early for the establishment 01 any deeper connection between
thern. The first poema which Ovid published are ‘Amorum libri
iit‘ elegias in which, 00 0 very young man, he describes his
experienoes and observatione in the province of love. They 010
written in the spirit 01 the time, when the intercourse 01 cultivated
men with beautiful and accomplished courtesans had become so
prevalent, that regular marriages were to an alarming extent on
the decresse. Hence we find that in most other poete 01 that age
similar connectione form the' theme 01 song; 0001101 them had
a lover to whom, with all the lire 01 passion and enthusiasm, he
dedicated his muse. This is the case with Horace, Tibullus, and
Propertius, and it is recorded 01 many others, whose works have
not corne down to us. Attempts have been made even attha
present day to determine how much truth and how much fiction
these delineatione contain3 and many have unwarrantably im·
