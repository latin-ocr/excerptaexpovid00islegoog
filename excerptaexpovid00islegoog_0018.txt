thedispleasnre of the emperor. In the later worlr he istieed from
= thisapprehension3 the anger of Augustus had lost its flret violence,
Ι andthere seemed some prospecte of the possibility of a recon-
ciliation. The poema were censured even in antiquity,on account
¹ of theirmonotonous character, ae they all re'volve within so small

acircle, and Ovid even felt himself called upon to vindicate them
against this charge. Butwe must not forget that, though we read
thern ina few hours, they were not written at short intervale3 but
their composition was continued through a space of eight years,
and they were addressed to the most various parties. We must
rather inquire whether each separate poem does not answer the
end which the poet had in view3 whether the different elegies,
though confined to the samesubject-mattcr, do not display variety
of description and richncss of invention ; and if we must answer
these questions in the affirmative, we shall feel ourselves forced
to admire the genius which could accomplish so much under such
unfavonrable circumstances. For Ovid complains bitterly of his
position, which so greatly obstructed hirn in the exorciso of his
art: he found even his life in danger, from the constant wars
which the hostile tribes wagsd against each other: hewas quite
cut off from the society of men who could understand him; he
could not even converse with those about him, for he was ignorant
of their language, and they of his, he wanted a tranquil, lonely
spot, where he could labour in peace. In the course of time he
felt himself estranged from home; he acquired the languagc of

. the Getae, and even attempted to write in it He now lost the
easy command which be had formerly possessed ouer his mother
longae, and hc tells ris how he had often to seek about for the
right word to express his thought, and did not always findit.
ln many of his later poems we cen pereeive traces of this con·
dition. But he was then nearly sixty years old-an age at which
poetic power, almost without exception, begins to fail. Angustus
died nn. 14, and there was little to hope from the hard-hearted
Tiberius. At length death put an end to the poet‘s missortunes
an. 16, the same year in which Rome lost another of its most
illustrious authors-the historiari Livy. With them closcs the
most splendid period of Roman literature, which we are accus·
tomed to term its Golden Age.

On the whole, Ovid rnay be considered as standing in the
highest rank among Roman poets; hc surpasscs most of them
in richness and versatility of poetic talent-he, if any, was born
a poet( Everything formed itself into verse under· his hands,
and he knew how to invest the most unlihely materials with
grace and beauty. Whoclse ever thought of attempting a
poetic treatment of a calendar? And yet how successfnlly did
