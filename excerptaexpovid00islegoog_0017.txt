peared in all probability ten years before; but even aster the
lapse of so long a period, Augustus still kept it in mind, and this
may serve as an indication os the attention which this poem bad
excited at Rome. The efforts of Augustus, as is well known,
were directed towards the improvement os the moral condition
-os the Romans, particularly in respect oi marriage. The forms os
society were in a state of decay, owing in a great measure to tha
mrrltitudes os slaves and freedmen with which tha city was in-
undated, and which threatened ιο supplant the original stoclr
of Romans. Augustus strove ιο effect a reform, partly by
penal enactments (lex J ulia de* adulteriis, lex Papia Poppaea),
partly by civic rewards and official promotione. But such a
change can naver be made ona sudden 3 the transitiou srom licen·
tiousuess to order must always be one of gradual progress, and
Augustus had the mortification to witness the fruitlessness of his
regulative measures. Old age attha same time made him irri-
table and passionem, and his anger could not but break out
against the man who had in effect done so much to counteract his
. efforts.' To this was now added the second ground of resentment,
probably some crime in the family of the emperor, in which per·
haps Agrippa Postumus, grandson os Augustus, was concerned.
How sar Ovid was involved in the matter it is impossible ιο
determine: he himself tells us that he had seen what he ought
not to have seen. It is enough that he fell under the displeasure
01⁴ Augustus, the old grudge on account of the Ars Amandi was
revived, and he was banished from Rome. Ovid ended his days
in Tomi, not without hopes, to the last moment, of a reversal of
his sentence, or of a mitigation of it so sar as ιο be allowed to
exchange Tomi for an abode in some civilised country. He was
sustained in his exile by this hope, and by the spiritual activity ³

only by the fact, that in the former he no longer conceals the
na'mes of those ιο whom they are addressed-which he had done
in the Tristia, lest it might prove disadvantageous to them to be
found maintaining a connection with a man who was subjected ιο
