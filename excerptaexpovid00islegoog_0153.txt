Optima uuuc sumat, qui sumere noluit ulla;

Nos inhonorati et donis patruelibus orbi,
Obtulimus quia nos ad prima pericula, simusl
Atque utinam aut verus furor ille aut creditus esset,
Nec comes hic Phrygias un uam venisset ad arces

Saxa moves gemitu, Laertiadaeque precaris

Quae meruit: quae, si di sunt, nou vana preceris!
Et huuc ille eadem uobis juratus in arma,

Prodere tem Danaam finxit, fictumque probavit
Crimen, et ostendit, quod jam praefoderat aurum.
Ergo aut exsilio vires subduxit Achivis,

Aut nece: sic pugnat, sic est metuendus Ulixes!
