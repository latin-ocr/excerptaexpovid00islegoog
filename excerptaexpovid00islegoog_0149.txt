maan an episode of some length the thread of the narrative is here
resumed, and a short account given of the death of Achilles.

Ar deus, aequoreas qui cuspide temperat undas, 580
In volucrem corpus nati Stheneleida versum

Mente dolet patria, saevumque perosus Achillem

Exercet memores plus quarn civiliter iras3

Jamque sere tracto duo per quinquennia bella, ,

Talibus intonsum compellat Sminthea dictis: 585
‘0 mihi de fratris lange gratissime natis,

Irrita qui mecum posuisti moenia Trojae‚

Ecquid, ubi has jam jam casuras adspicis arces,

Ingemis 3 aut ecquid tot defendentia muros

Milia caesa dolesl Ecquid, ne persequar omnes, 590
Hectoris umbra subit circam sua Pergama tracti,

Cum tamen ille ferox belloque cruentior ipso

Vivit adhuc, o eris nostri populator, Achillest

Det mihi se: thiro, triplici quid cuspide possim,

citizens should act towards citizens3 hence: moderately, consider·
ately. Plus qnam civiliter. Mn is is usually joined to adjectirea
and adverbs; plus is strictly employed to indicate that the adjective
does not exaetly express the truth‚ dces not completely exhaust the
thought. Just as in the present passage, Lucan says in the begin·
ning oi his poem: Bella plus quarn civilia, more than civil wars,
wara between sach as stand in a still nearer relation than that os
citizen to citizen. So in Livy: Perfidia plus quam Panica3 Cic.
Patr. ii. 13: Confitebor ecs plus quam sicarios esse. Exercet iras,
not outwardly, in actions, but concipit animo, gerit anima-585.
