TEISTIUM LIB. Ι.
aunam 1.

Tuis poem serves as an introduction to the five books of elegies
which Ovid wrote iri his exile, and sent to Rome. ·

Panna, uec invideo, sine me, liber, ibis in Urbem:
Hei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo.

Vade, sed incultus, qualem decet exsulis esse 5
Infelix habiturn temporis hujus habe.

Nec te purpureo velerit vaccinia fuco:
Non est conveniens luctibus ille color ;

Nec titulus minio, nec cedro charta notetur,
Candida nec nigra cornua fronte geras.
Felices ornent haec instrumenta libellos3
Fortunae memorem te decet esse meae. 10

1. Nec invideo, and Ι do not rudge it you-3. lucanos, sine

exsul, dicor iri illo (edicto). The difference consisted in this, that
the relegatus was not deprived of his civil ri lits, and might there·
fore oherish the hope of a retum to liis nativelaud. Ovio, however,
frequentlf⁸ calls himself exsul without particular reference to his
tuttillilltlrnlllrssilr 11ἵὲ1111111181111111111
Veiens, cover. emust imagine some kind of coverin ‚adorned
with beautiful colours (purplureo fuco). Such a cover was irequeniiy
made of parchment, attae ed to the end of the roll, and wrepped
round the whole-7. Titulus, the title of the book, on the cover.
Cedro, oleo cedrino. Oil of cedar was made use of to preserve
boolrs from worma. There is a certain degree of luxury in this,
which Ovid thinks his present situation forbids him. Hence also
he uses the word notare, to distinguish a thing umong its equale. -
8. Cornua, the two projecting ends of tha sticli round which the
manuscript was rolled. These were sometimes coloured, some-
times ornamented with ebony‚ ivory (candida), or precious matals.
Nigra fronte. Frons is the upper and lower rim o the roll, which
was made mooth (poliantur pumice, v.ll), and then coloured. Μ· ,
