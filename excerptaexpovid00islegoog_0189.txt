Dascntrrrorr of a processioa in honour of lunc at Falerii, and tta
’ origin os that city.

Con mihi pomiferis conjux foret orta Faliscis,
Moenia contigimus, vrcta, Camilla, tibi.
Casta sacerdotes lunoni festa parabant
Per celebres ludos indigenamque bovem.
Grande morae pretium ritus cognoscere, quamvis 5
Difficilis clivis huc via praebet iter.
Stat retus et densa praenubilus arbore lucus.
Adspice: concedas numen inesse loco.
Accipit ara preces votivaque tura piorum,
Ara per antiquas facta sine arte manus.
Hinc ubi praesonuit sollemni tibia cantu,
lt per velatas annua pompa vias.
Ducuntur niveae populo plaudente juvencae,
Quas aluit campis herba Falisca suis,
Et vituli noudum metuenda fronte minaces,
Et minor ex humili victima porcus hara,
Duxque gregis cornu per tempora dura recurvo

mined. The expression ortcforet (not sit) shows that thc marriage¹
here ref'erred to was again dissolved, so that his third wife cannot

which the town of Falerii in Etruria belonged. Juno Curitis, οι·
Quiritis, was here ori inally worshipped, from which we rna assume
that there was a Sa ine clement in the population. hen the
Romans afterwards sent a colony to Falerii, they called it Colonia,

Falerii also was involved in the war, and was conquercd by Carnif-
