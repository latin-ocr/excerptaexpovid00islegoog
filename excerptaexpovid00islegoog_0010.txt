ΙΝ a series of books intended 101 schools, it· requires no
apology that Ovidis presented only in extracto. ·However
little this method may recommend itself in general, it was
· unavoidable in the present case, aud the utmost that could

bc attempted was to introduce, as far as possible, lengthened
and connected pieces. The collection is divided into two

parts : the first and larger, consisting 01 hexameters taken
from the Metamorphoses, aud the second, 01 elegiae verses

from most 01 the remaining works. The extracts are given

in the order in which they ’1101111 in the books, aud the

original numbering 01 the lines has been preserved. I
imagined that by this means a tolerable idea 01 the whole
might be more easily conveyed to the student, while at the
same time the toacher who may be disposed to follow a
different order, as that according to the historical or mytho-
logical connection 01 the fables, can have no difficulty in
doing so.

In the text I have followed the editi0n 01 Jahn (Leipzig,
1828-1832, two parts iu 3 vols. 8vo) as far as it extends:
it presente the advantage 01 atext, in some measure
authentia, which had, properly speaking, been lost ,since
the otherwise valuable editions 01 Heinsius and Burmann.
Merkel's edition 01 the Metamorphoses did not appear till
the greater part 01 the manuscriptae far as this poem is
concerned, was out 01 my hands. For the Fasti I have
employed the edition 01 Merkel, and 101 the Tristia that 01
Iners. I have departed from these authorities only ina
few passages, where the immediate desigu 01 the work

seemed 10 require it.
