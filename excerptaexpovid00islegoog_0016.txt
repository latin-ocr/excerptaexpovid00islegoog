as stom the occurrence os Italian and Sicilian sables ia the Meta·
morphoses, we may saiely inser that hadid not adhers closely
toliis Greek models, but gave free play to his imagination,
inserted materiale of his own, and gave the general colouring to
metabole. Another point to be borne in mind with regard to the
Metamorphoses is, that it is an unfinished productiori. On the
sudden turn oi his fortune, Ovid burnt his own copy os the posim

end it is only srom nanscripts, which were already in the hands
ol others, that it has come down to us. Although abeunding ia
beauties, we must not sorget that it not only has not received
the last touch ol the master’s hand,but thatin many passages
ve bave merely the first rude outline. Ovid says oi himself 2
‘Quidquid tentabam scribere, versus erat3’ and thus we see
that even the first rough sketches which hs threw off assumed a
metrical form (as one example cut os many, see Macar. vii. 350-
397). We find the same fable occurring also in different repre·
sentations, which our poet would certainly not have allowed, had
hs given the work a final revision. ln fine, while we recognise
the beauties os the Metamorphoses, we must, in considerationes
the circumstances just mentioned, be sparing in our censure oi its
delecta.

The same is the case with the Fasti. This work also was inter-
rupted-it is true afterwards taken up again, not, however, lor the
purpose ol completing it, but sor the purpose of improving what
was already written, and ol ‚making insertions in particular
parts, hence it happens that we have only before us the first
sir months ol the calendar. Notwithstanding this, the work
isinvaluable to us, on account ol the rich store oi information
which it contains with regard to the ancient Italian sables and
religious usages, which would otherwise have remained quite
unknown to us. Ovid had evidently, with a view to this work,
undertaken a peculiar and very comprehensive course of study,
in which he enjoyed the assistance and encouragement of his
friend Hyginus. With regard to the execution os the Fasti, tbe
sanie must be said as os the Metamorphoses: the whole is devoid
of unity of plan, the particular parts are wanting in exactness os
finish, but the work abounds in admirable passages, each sorm-
ing a subject of itsell. lt consiste os six books, each of which
embraces one month ol the calendar.

The catastrophe which forms the turning-point in the lise os
Ovio happened about the year 8 nu, when he had already passed
his fiftieth year. By a special degree os Augustus, he was banished
to Tomi, a city ol Thrace, on the Black Sea. The reasons cf this
decree are involved in obscurity: Ovid assigna two: iirst, the Ars
Amandi3 aad secondly, what he calls an error, about which we
can at best only speculata. The Ars Amandi had indeed ap-
