GIGANTES.

Tan story of a new creation of men resulting from the storming of
heaven hythe ginnts, and the following one of Deucalion and
· Pyrrha, though evidently unconnected with the feble of the four
Ages, are here added by Ovid on account of the similarity of
their character. The storming of heaven hythe giants is not
mentioned by Homer or Hesiod, and was therefore probably in.
vented by later poets: ovid here alludes to it very briefly. The
formation of a new racc of men from the blood οἲ the giunta
seems tc have been taken from one of the Gigantomaehiae, of
which the Greeks had several, bnt is only known to us from this

passage. The fable is hore quite loosely appended.
