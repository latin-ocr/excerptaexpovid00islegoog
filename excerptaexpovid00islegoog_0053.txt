Arsurusque iterum Xanthus flavusque Lycormas, 245
Quique recurvatis ludit Maeandros in undis,

Aestuat Alpheae, ripae Spercheides ardent, 250
Quodque suo Tagus amne vehit, fluit ignibus, aurum 3

Ooouluitque eaput, quod adhuc latet: ostia septem 255
Pulvemlenta vacant septem sinc flumine valles.

Cuique fuit rerum promissa potentia, Thybrin.
