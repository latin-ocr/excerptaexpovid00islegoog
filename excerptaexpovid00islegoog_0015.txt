Our poet was in the meantime advancing in years, and he may
have felt that such frivolous subjecte as had hitherto exclusively
occupied his muse were no longer euitable for him. Hie friends
aleo were now advaneed iu life, and had turned their attention to
more serioue studies: their influence on Ovid, who always easily
suffered himself to be determined from without, was great, and
be resolved to oocupy himself with some worthier task. The
result of this resolution was a tragedy, ⁶ Medea,' which received
great applause from his contemporaries ae well as from later
critice, but which ie now lost. Whether he followed the Medea
of Euripides, or cut out a new path for himself, it is now im·
possible to decide. In either case it remained the only dramatio
attempt of our poet We next find him occupied with two great
poetical works, at which he appears to have laboured simul-
taneously-the ‘Metamorphoses’ and the ‘Fasti’ In the former
he treateof those parts of the ancient mythology in which trans-
formatione occur, and draws mainly from Greek eources, the
latter, in which he describes the Roman festivals aud their occa·
. sione, in the order in which they occur in the calendar, is a
thoroughly native productiori In the former, therefore, he entered
the lists with many contemporaries and predecessore, in the
latter, he pursued a path entirely his own.

It may be assumed with great probability that the Metamor-
phoses was composed on the model of one or more Greek poenis
extant in the age of Ovid. The literature of Greece abeunded in
werke the plan of which was to unite into one whole a variety of
subjecte having no necessary iuternal connection with each other 5
the Theogonis, the Heroogonia, the Kmdreyog γυναικῶν of Hesiod,
may serve ae examples from the earliest antiquity. This style of
composition was carried to an extreme in the Alexandrian age,
when the fire of original genius had gone out, and displays of
eruditiori took the place of true poetic effert. In the laet century
Before the Christian era, the literature of Greece exercised an
undue influence over Roman genius. The poetry which had
sprung up on the Italian soil, nourished with Italian conceptione,
and striking out into Italian forms, was supplanted by a foreign
growth, and the independent development of an original Roman
poetry was thus seriously obstructed. But since this was the
direction which Roman literature had taken, Ovid yielded to the
general tendency, and he appears in the composition of the
Metamorphoses to have followed one or more of the later Greek
poete. It is impossible to speak decidedly on thie subject, because
we cannot bring our suppositione to the test of an actual compa-
rieon, all the Greek worke of a similar character, frorn which we
might form a correct judgment, being loet But from what wa
know of the richneee and inventiveneee of Orid'e genius, as well
