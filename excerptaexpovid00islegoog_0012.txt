P. Ovrnrns Naso, in one os his later worlrs (Trici. iulo), has
himself surnished us with a minute account ol his iiie and sor·
tunes. Resides this, he frequently takes occasion to speak os
himself and particular events os his career, so that there are lew
writers os antiquity with regard to whom we have more authen·
tic information. Several biographies of him bave also corne
down to us from a later period ol antiquity, but these contain lew
facts ol importauce which were not already to be sound in the
poema themselves. .

P. Ovidius Naso was born at Sulmo, in the country os the
Peligni, the year aller the assassination oi Caesar, ac. 43. His
father belonged to the equestrian order, and was possessed ol a
large fortune, as appears from the education which he bestowed
on Ovid and his brother, who was only a year older than him·
sels, as well as from the independence with which our poet, in
later years, pursued his own inclinations, without devoting him·
seli to any profession. The youths were brought to Rome at
an early age, and there placed under the most distinguished
teaclrers: among these we find particularly mentioned Μ Porcius
Latro, and Arellius Fuscus, who instructed their pupils in the
grammatical and rhetorical studies of the day, introduced them
to an acquaintance with literature, and directed them in the
exercise ol their own original powers. The practice ol oratory-
discussions on prescribed rhemos-constituted a main element in
this education, which had sor its ultimate object to form the
soture statesman, to lit him sor administrativa and judicial offioes,
that, at the close os his career, he might, as a senator, devote the
political insigbt which he had acquired to the conductos the
government in the most comprehensive sense. But this sphera
os activity had lost all its cbarms under the absolute rule ol
Augustus. Ambition had no longera worthy goal set before it:
