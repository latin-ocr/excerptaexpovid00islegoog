Cum perit, et coepi parte carere mei.
Cepimus et tenerae primos aetatis honores,
Deque viris quondam pars tribas una fui.
Curia restabat; clavi mensura coacta est:
Majus erat nostris viribus illud onus.
Nec patiens corpus nec mens fuit apta labori,
sollicitaeque fugax ambitionis eram 3

oria, judicio semper amata meo,
Temporis illius colui fovique poetas,

Ponticus heroo, Bassus quoque clarus iambo,
Dulcia convictus membra fuere mei3
Et tenuit nostras numerosus Horatius aures,
Dum ferit Ausonia carmina culta lyra. 50 ,

equestrian orden-39. Aoniae sorores, the Muses, because Helicon
is in Aonia3 that is, Boeotia-⁴13. Saepe snos volueres-Macer.
There were two Latin poets of this name-Aemilius Macer and C.
Licinius Macer. The reference is here to the former. He wrote a
poem, in imitation of Nicander, on birds, serpente, plante, dcc,
which is now lost. He was born at Verona, and was. a friend of
virgins-45. Propertius. S. Aurelius Propertius, whose elegiis
are still extant. Recitore, in a company of friends in order to re-

pression wnh Propertius-47. entiam, a less-known poet of that
age, who wrote a poem in hexameter verse (heroo, sc. versu) nn tlrc
war of the Seven against Thebes. Bassus, a poet mentioned also
by Propertius. He is'clerus iambo, from which we may garher that
he excelled in u spectes of composition lihe the epodos of Horace,
or the hendecasyllabi of Catullus, after the model of Archilochus,
or perhaps in satirical poems ‚which are sometimes called iambi.-
