Cum perit, et coepi parte carere mei.
Cepimus et tenerae primos aetatis honores,

There were two Latin poeta of this name-Aemilius Macer and C.

poem, in imitation of Nicander, on birds, serpente, plants, dcc,
which is now lost. He was born at Verona, and wasa friend of
Virgil's.—45. Propertius. S. Aurelius Propertius, whose elegies
are still extant. Recitare, in a company of friends, in order to re-
ceive their judgment before publication. This was a general cus-

pression wrth Propertius-47. octiens, elesa-known poet of that
ago, who wrote a poem in hexameter verse (heroo, se. versu) on tlte
wm of the Seven against Thebes. Bassus, a poet mentioned also
by Propertius. He islclaras iambo, from which we may gether that
he excelled in a species of composition like the epodas of Horace,
or the hendecasyllabi of Catullus, al'ter the model of Archilochus,
or perhaps in satirical poema 'which are sometimes called iambi.-
