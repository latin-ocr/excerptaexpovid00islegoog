Est lacus antiqua religione sacer.
llic latet Hippolytus furiis direptus equorum, 265
Unde nemus nullis illud aditur equis.
Licia dependent longas velantia se es,
Et posita est meritae multa tabella deae.
See poiens voti frontem redimita coronis
emina lucentes portat ab urbe faces. 270
Regna tenent fortesque manu pedibusque fugaces,
’ Et perit exemplo postmodo quisque suo.
Deflurt incerto lapidosus murmure rivus:
Saepe, sed exiguis haustibus inde bibi.
Egeria est quae praebet aquas, dea grata Camenis. 275
Illa Numae conjunx consiliumque luit.
Principio nimium promptos ad bella Quirites
Molliri placuit jure deumque metu.
Inde datae leges, ne firmior omnia posset,
coeptaque sunt pure tradita sacra coli. 280
Eruitur feritas, armisque potentius aequum est,
Etcum cive pudet conseruisse manus.
Atque aliquis, modo trux, visa jam veniturum,
Vinaque dat tepidis farraque salsa locis.

only be drunk of iu small quantities. erhaps also we may sup-
pose that the sountuin had arr inspiring power, and that large
