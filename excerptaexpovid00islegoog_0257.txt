Cum perit, et coepi parte carere mei.
Cepimus et tenerae primos aetatis honores,
Deque viris quondam pars tribas una fui.
Curia restabat ; olari mensura coacta est:
Majus erat nostris viribus illud onus.
Nec patiens corpus nec mens fuit apta labori,
sollicitaeque fugax ambitionis eram3
Et petere Aoniae suadebant tuta Sorores
Otia, judicio semper amata mco.
Temporis illius colui fovique poetas,
Quotque aderant vates, rebar adesse deos.
Saepe suas volucres legit mihi grandior aevo,

Saepe suos solitus recitare Propertius ignes, 45
Jure sodalitii qui mihi junctus erat.
Ponticus heroo, Bassus quoque clarus iambo,
Dulcia convictus membra fuere mei3
Et tenuit nostras numerosus Horatius aures,
Dum ferit Ausonia earmina culta lyra. 50,

34. Deque ciria quondam pars tribus una ui. There were a number
of tresviri or triumviri at Rome; the re erence is here to the trium-
viri capitales, who held one of the inferior jurisdictione, and had
char eof the prisona-35. Curia restabat. 'l'he Curia stands here
as tie place where the meetings of senate were held, properly
Curia Hostilia. Before claui mensura we must supply sed: I had
now only to enter the senate, but Ι retired of my own accord,
adopted, instead of the latus clavus, the an ustus, the badge of the
equestrian ordea—39. Aoniae sorores, the uses, because Helicon
isin Aonia; that is, Boeotia—43. Saepe suas uolucres-Macer.
There were two Latin poets of this name-Aemilius Macer and C.
Licinius Macer. The reference is here to the former. He wrote a
poem, in imitation of Nicander, on birds, serpente, plante, dac,
which is now lost. He was born at Verona, and was. a friend of
Virgil’s.—45. Propertius. S. Aurelius Propertius, whose elegiis
are still extant. Recitata in a company of friends, in order to rea
ceive their judgment before publication. This was a general cus·
tom among the poete of that a e. Ignes, amores, afavourite ex·
pressiori with Propertius-47. anticus, alass-known poet of that
age, who wrote a poem in hexameter verse (beroa, sc. versu) on the
war of the Seven against Thebes. Bassus, a poet mentioned also
by Propertius. He isclarus wardo, from which we may guther that
he excelled in a specics of composition like the epodes of Horace,
or the hendecasyllabi of Catullus, after the model cf Archilochus,
or perhaps in satirical poems ,which are sometimes called iambi.-
50. Dum serit-lyra. In strictness, we can only say lyram ferire;
but the transition from this expression to carmina lyra ferire is easy,
and occurs in other poete. Armonio lyra, Italica or Latina lyra.-
