MunAMORPH. LIB. XII.
cronos nu acaunus

Onna locus medio est inter terrasque fretumque ¹
Caelestesque plagas, triplicis confinia mundi, to
Unde quod est nsquam, quamvis regionibus absit,

inspicitur, penetratque cavas vox omnis ad aures:
lanstanet, summaque domum sibi legit in arce,
innumerosque aditus ac mille foramina tectis

Addidit, et nullis inclusit limina portis3 45
Nocte dieque patent. Tota est ex aere sonanti,

'fcta fremit vocesque refert, iteratque quod audit.

Nulla quies intus, nullaque silentia parte;

Nec tamen est clamor, sed parvae murmura vocis,

Qualia de pelagi, si quis procul audiat, undis 50
Esse solent, qualemve sonum, cum Jupiter atras

Increpuit nubes, extrema tonitrua reddunt.

39. The delineation os the goddess Fama is a favourite subject
with tha ancient poets, and has been handled by many of thern in
longer or shorter descripticns: that of Virgil in the fourth book of
therleneid is a celebrated one. We have, however, no reason to
suppose that Ovid had any of these passages in his eye3 his own
poetic vein was rich enough to furnish him with all the features in
this picture-40. Triplicis confinio mundi. In these words the poet
turns up what hc has just said: the threefold world is therefore
heaven, earth, and sea-41. Regionibur is ablative of reference;
