auouuar nra. 1. 177

Mortale est, quod quaeris, opus ς mihi lama perennia
Quaeritur, in toto semper ut orbe eanar.
Vivet Maeonides, Tenedos dum stabit et lde,
Dum rapidas Simois in mare volvet aquas. 10
Vivet et Aseraeus, dum mustis uva tumebit,
Dum cadet incurva salse resecta Ceres.
Battiades semper toto cantabitur orbe 3
Quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet.
Nulla Sophocleo veniet jactura cothurno.
Cum sole et luna semper Aratus erit.
Dum fallax servus, durus pater, improba lena
Vivent, dum meretrix blanda, Menandrosent.
Ennius arte carens animosique Accius oris
Casurum nullo tempore nomen habent. 20

is perhaps an allusion, in the bitter expression of this line, to an

anlavorahle receptiou which he may have ruet witlr ou his appearing
in public-7. Mihi Quaeritur, a me quaeritur, ego quaero lamam
perennem—9. Maeonides, Homer. lt is well known that the hon·
our of having given birth to Homer was contested by different Greek
cities: Smyrna is here assumed us his birthplace,u Greek city in
Maeoniaor Lydia. It is to be ohserved, that instead of the gentile
adjective (Maeonius), we have here, by apaetic usage, the patro-
nymic form: Homer is therehy represented aa a soa os the country
Maeonia. Tenedos, an island in the Aegean Sea, opposite Troy.
Ida, a mountain in the neighbourhood ol Troy-10. Simot's, a river
in Troas. These localities are osten mentioned in the Iliad-ll.
Ascraeos, Hesiod, born in Ascra, a town ol Boeotia. His poem
Ἔρ o rath tpar treats chiefly os husbandry. We have other poema
by him, which, however, were not so universally ascribed to him
as the one Just mentioned, and hence Ovrd refers only to the latter.
—12. Ceres, lor seges, as Minerva for weaur' , &ce-13. Battiades,
⁵ Callimachus of Cyrene, the city of the Battia oe. He lived at Alex·
andria under Ptolemy Philadel hus. The judgment which Ovid
here passas on Callimachus, applles more or less to all the Alexan·
driau poeta: they are distinguished sor ingenuity and learnrn rather
than true poetic genius-15. S troclea rothomo. Sophocles, tha
celebrated Athenian poet, seven dl whose tragedias have come down
to us. Callemus, the high shoe 'which the tragtc actors wore to
raise them to the dignity of the characters which they represented,
usually gods aud princes-16. Aratus, the author of a poem on the
course of the stara, which is still extant-18. Menandros, usually
Menander, a cornia poet who belongs to the period of the so·
called New·Comedy. In it were represented the failings es human
nature, especially as the show themselves in the sphera al the mid-
dle classes. We know him only lrorn the imitations of Terence.-
19. Ennius, alriend ofthe younger ScipioAfricanus, the firstltalran
poet who made use ol hexameter verse, und wrote inutmttatron ol
the Greeks. His works, however, were still wantin ru polrsh and
grace (arte carens). Accius, or Attius, the most celebrated tragie
