Cum perit, et coepi parte carere mei.
Cepimus et tenerae primos aetatis honores,
Deque viris quondam pars tribua una fui.
Curia restabat 3 olari mensura coacta est:
Majus erat nostris viribus illud onus.
Neo patiens corpus neo mens fuit apta labori,
sollicitaeque fugax ambitionis eram3
Et petere Aoniae suadebant tuta Sorores
oria, judicio semper amata meo,
Temporis illius colui forique poetas,
Quotque aderant vates, rebar adesse deos⁴
Saepe suas volucres legit mihi grandior aevo,

Saepe suos solitus recitare Propertius ignes, 45
Jure sodalitii qui mihi junctus erat.

Dulcia convictus membra fuere mei3
Et tenuit nostras numerosus Horatius aures,
Dum ferit Ausonia carmina culta lyra. 50,

adopted, instead of tlte latus clavus, thaan ustus, the badge of the
equestrian order—39. Aoniae sorores, the bluses, because Helicon
isin Aonia; that is, Boeotia-43. Saepe suas uolucres-Macer.
There were two Latin poets of this name-Aemilius Macer and G.
Licinius Macer. The reference is here to the former. He wrote a
poem, in imitation of Nicander, on birds, serpente, plante, deo,
which is now lost. He was born at Verona, and wasa friend of
virgins-45. Propertius. S. Aurelius Propertius, whose elegi'es
are still extant. Recitore, in a company of friends, in order to re·
ceive their judgment before publication. This was a general cus-
tom among the poets of that a e. Ignes, amores, afavonritc ex·
pressiori with Propertius-47. antuus, alass-known poet of that
age, who wrote a poem in hexameter verse (heroo, se. versu) on tlre
war of the Seven against Thebes. Bassus, a poet mentioned also
by Propertius. He isbclorus iambo, from which we may gether that
lre excelled in a species of composition like the apodes of Horace,
or the hendecasyllabi of Catullus, after tlte model of Archilochus,
or perhaps in satirical poerns 'which are sometimes called iambi.-
50. Dum serit-lyra. Iu eructuem, we can only say lyram ferire;
but the transirion from this expression to carmina lyra ferire is easy,
