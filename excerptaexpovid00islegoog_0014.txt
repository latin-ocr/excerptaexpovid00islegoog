oesslrd as well as unsuccessr‘ul lore which can occat in such
aocnnection. The lact that so many writers ol‘ that age
coincide both in the general tone· and in the special objecta os
their poetry, makes it plain that we have here to deal with the
poet rather than with the biographer; and Ovid himself tells
ur, in oue ol his later werke, in allusion to the charges brought
against his earlier poems, that his lile bad been spent without
aoy heincus transgressione At the same time, we are sar from
loching upon him as a model of virtue3 the whole era was
dissolute and corrupt, and all the pcets of whom we have any
exact knowledge would be exposed to serious censure it tried
hythe standard of the present day: Ovid had already had two
wives, and been separated from both; he had a daughter, pro·
bably by the second. All that we contend sor is, that he was
no worse than his contemporaries, and that we are not justified
in taking all his poetical and sancisnl descriptione sor biographical
realities. The truer to nature these picturas are, and the more
lilelike their colouring, the more must we be on our guard
against drawing unwarrantable conclusione from thern. Itis
the excellence cs the poems which has chiefly occasioned the
misreprssentations ot‘ the author-and the misrepresentations
are a procl of the excellence.

The approval which Ovid met with in the career on which he
had entered, induced him to persevere in it, and to attempt a
nater poem on the same subject Trne poetic same then, aa·
nov, resulted chiefly from lengthened and continuone works:
Virgil in particular had thus gained imperishable glory, and was
locisd up to by the younger poets as a model. Ovid therefore
also attempted in his province to produce a more comprehensive
work, the ‘Ars Amandi,' which he completed in three books,
lilewise in the elegiae measure. This poem is in its way one os
the most perfect that have come down to us from Roman anti-
quity. The poet brings together, and reduces, as it were, to
a system all the arta with which the one sex gain and pre·
serve the attachment of the other, ‘and illustratas his instruc·
tions by mythological examples and comparisons, ci which his
extensive acquaintance with the Greek poets furnished him an
abundant supply. The opposite side os the subject also occu·
pied his attention, and he wrote the ‘Remedia Amoris,’ in one
boolr in the same measure. There is still extant a considerable
fragment os a poem (⁸ Medicamina Faciei ’) in which he describes
the arts of the tollet then in use to preserve and improve the
complexion. The ‘Heroides,' letters l'rom heroines to their

absent husbands, form the last work in this class os poema m
which Ovid had no predecessor, and with which he may be truly
said to have euriched the literature cl Rome.
